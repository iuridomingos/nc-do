## 📋 What is nc-do?

nc-do is a lightweight, quick todo app you use right from the command line. It runs in a text window on Unix-like systems. The app uses ncurses, a tool that helps programs create simple, easy-to-read interfaces in the terminal.

This means you do not need to open a web browser or a heavy program to track your tasks. With nc-do, everything happens in your terminal window. It's easy to add, view, and remove tasks quickly.
